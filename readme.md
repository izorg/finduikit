# Find UI Kit

A hobby project that helps developers discover and compare UI component libraries across different JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, and Solid). The application aggregates information from GitHub repositories, categorizing UI kits by framework compatibility, features, and popularity metrics.

The searchable interface allows filtering and comparison of UI libraries based on various criteria, helping developers make informed decisions about which UI kit best fits their project requirements.

Built with:

- React
- TypeScript
- Radix UI for components
- GitHub API integration for repository data
